This repository holds the website for the organization Tales of Harmonia, as designed by Barry during the 2013-2014 academic year.

Tales of Harmonia is a choir from the University of Toronto founded on the motto "Something for Everyone," in attempt to promote a positive space for members to learn, grow, and showcase themselves as individuals and as part of the ensemble. The choir performs a variety of genres and types of concerts. Tales of Harmonia is affiliated with the Engineering Society and Ulife, and has members from faculties across the University.

This website was designed as a replacement to the initial website set up on the Student Spaces provided by Ulife, which was a basic Wordpress website. In order to further refine the website, HTML5 and CSS were used in conjunction to better suit the needs of the choir.
